/*!
Compact, clone-on-write vector and string.

## Types
- An [`EcoVec`] is a reference-counted thin vector. It takes up one word of
  space (= 1 usize). Within its allocation it stores a reference count, its
  length, and its capacity.

- An [`EcoString`] is a reference-counted string with inline storage. It takes
  up 16 bytes of space. It has 14 bytes of inline storage and starting from 15
  bytes it becomes an [`EcoVec<u8>`].

## Example
```
// This is stored inline.
let small = ecow::EcoString::from("Welcome");

// This spills to the heap, but only once: `big` and `third` share the
// same underlying allocation. Vectors and spilled strings are only
// really cloned upon mutation.
let big = small + " to earth! ðŸŒ±";
let mut third = big.clone();

// This allocates again to mutate `third` without affecting `big`.
assert_eq!(third.pop(), Some('ðŸŒ±'));
assert_eq!(third, "Welcome to earth! ");
```

| Type                                        | Details |
|:--------------------------------------------|:--------|
| [`Vec<T>`][vec] / [`String`][string]        | Normal vectors are a great general purpose data structure. But they have a quite big footprint (3 machine words) and are expensive to clone. The [`EcoVec`] has a bit of overhead for mutation, but is small and cheap to clone. |
| [`Arc<Vec<T>>`][arc] / [`Arc<String>`][arc] | This requires two allocations instead of one and is less convenient to mutate. |
| [`Arc<[T]>`][arc] / [`Arc<str>`][arc]       | While this only requires one allocation and has an acceptable footprint with 2 machine words, it isn't mutable. |
| Small vector                                | Different trade-off. Great when `T` is small, but expensive to clone when spilled to the heap. |
| Small string                                | The [`EcoString`] combines different small string qualities into a very practical package: It has inline storage, a smaller footprint than a normal [`String`][string], is efficient to clone even when spilled, and at the same time mutable. |
